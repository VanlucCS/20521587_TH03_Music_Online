I could have my Gucci on
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothing on
Bet I made you look
I made you look
I made you double take
Soon as I walk away
Call up your chiropractor
Just in case your neck break
Tell me whatcha whatcha
What're you gon' do
Cause I'm about to make a scene
Double up that sunscreen
I'm about to turn the heat up
Gonna make your glasses steam
Tell me whatcha whatcha
What're you gon' do
When I do my walk, walk
I can guarantee
Your jaw would drop, drop
Cause they don't make
A lot of what I got, got
Ladies if you feel me
This your bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop
I could have my Gucci on
Gucci on
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothing on
Bet I made you look
I made you look
Yeah I look good in
My Versace dress
Take it off
But I'm hotter
When my morning hair's a mess
But even with my hoodie on
Bet I made you look
I made you look
And once you get a taste
You'll never be the same
This ain't that ordinary
It's that fourteenth karat cake
Tell me whatcha whatcha
What're you gon' do
When I do my walk, walk
I can guarantee
Your jaw would drop, drop
Cause they don't make
A lot of what I got, got
Ladies if you feel me
This your bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop
I could have my Gucci on
Gucci on
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothing on
Bet I made you look
Said I made you look
Yeah I look good in
My Versace dress
Take it off
But I'm hotter
When my morning hair's a mess
But even with my hoodie on
Bet I made you look
Said I made you look
