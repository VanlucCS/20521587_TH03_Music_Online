There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out
And I'll lay your sheet bare
See how I'll leave
With every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking
That we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking
That we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings
To find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind
And reap just what you sow
You're gonna wish you
Never had met me
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
It all, it all, it all
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
You played it, you played it
You played it to the beat
