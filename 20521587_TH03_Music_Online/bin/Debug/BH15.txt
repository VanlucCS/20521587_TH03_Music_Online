Savage Looove
If I woke up without
I don't know what I would
Thought I could be single
Forever 'till I met you
Usually don't be fallin' be fallin' first
You gotta way of keeping me
Comin' back to back
I just found out the only reason
That you lovin' me
Is to get back at your ex looover
But before you leave
Usually I would never
Would never even care
Baby I know she creepin'
I feel it in the air
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage looove
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage looove
But when you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage looove
Your savage looove-looove-looove
Your savage looove-looove-looove
You could use me
Cos I still want that your savage
Baby I hope this ain't karma cos
I get around
You wanna run it up
I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin'
Be fallin' fallin' first
You gotta way of making me
Spend up all my cash
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage looove
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage looove
But when you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage looove
Your savage looove-looove-looove
Your savage looove-looove-looove
You could use me
Cos I still want that your
Savage looove
Your savage looove-looove-looove
Your savage looove-looove-looove
You could use me
Baby
Savage looove
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage looove
But when you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage looove (savage looove)
Your savage looove-looove-looove
Your savage looove-looove-looove
You could use me
Cos I still want that your
Savage loooveee
