Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here
But you're not
'cause the drinks bring back
All the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones
That we lost on the way
'cause the drinks bring back
All the memories
And the memories bring back
Memories bring back you
There's a time that I remember
When I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever
And everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December
When somebody say your name
'cause I can't reach out to call you
But I know I will one day yeah
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here
But you're not
'cause the drinks bring back
All the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that
We lost on the way
'cause the drinks bring back
All the memories
And the memories bring back
Memories bring back you
Memories bring back
Memories bring back you
There's a time that I remember
When I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred
Was too powerful to stop
Now my heart feel like an ember
And it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya
That you know i'll never drop yeah
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here
But you're not
'cause the drinks bring back
All the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that
We lost on the way
'cause the drinks bring back
All the memories
And the memories bring back
Memories bring back you
Memories bring back
Memories bring back you
Memories bring back
Memories bring back you
Memories bring back
Memories bring back you
