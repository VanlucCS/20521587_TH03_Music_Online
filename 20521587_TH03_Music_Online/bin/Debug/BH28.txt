Bài hát: Drive My Car - Deamn

Hey babe, you could be my lover
Honey, I don’t need another one
Can you come a little closer?
Someday we’ll sleep under the covers

Drive my car
It’s gametime
Hold me like you do
Hold me like you do

Make me high
I can’t deny
I’m in love with you
I’m in love with you

You know, you’re my perfect lover
Trust me, I don’t need another one
Can you come a little closer?
Someday we’ll sleep under the covers

Drive my car
It’s gametime
Hold me like you do
Hold me like you do

Make me high
I can’t deny
I’m in love with you
I’m in love with you
